  abstract = {Nine decades of rocket engine and gas turbine development have shown that thermoacoustic oscillations are difficult to predict but can usually be eliminated with relatively small ad hoc design changes. These changes can, however, be ruinously expensive to devise. This review explains why linear and nonlinear thermoacoustic behavior is so sensitive to parameters such as operating point, fuel composition, and injector geometry. It shows how nonperiodic behavior arises in experiments and simulations and discusses how fluctuations in thermoacoustic systems with turbulent reacting flow, which are usually filtered or averaged out as noise, can reveal useful information. Finally, it proposes tools to exploit this sensitivity in the future: adjoint-based sensitivity analysis to optimize passive control designs and complex systems theory to warn of impending thermoacoustic oscillations and to identify the most sensitive elements of a thermoacoustic system. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics Volume 50 is January 5, 2018. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.},

Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the flame, placed in an acoustically anechoic environment and subjected to broad-band, low-amplitude acoustic forcing, generates time series of fluctuating heat release rate, velocities and pressure. The time series data is post-processed with system identification to estimate the impulse response and transfer function of the flame. The associated frequency response is validated against experiment with good accuracy. \{DNS\} results obtained with acoustic excitation from the inlet or outlet boundary, respectively, confirm that the flame responds predominantly to perturbations of velocity. The stability of eigenmodes related to intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback is investigated with a network model. Both stable and unstable intrinsic thermoacoustic modes are predicted, depending on details of the configuration. The predicted modes are directly observed in direct numerical simulations, with good agreement in frequencies and stability.},

  shorttitle = {Symmetry Breaking of Azimuthal Thermoacoustic Modes},
  doi = {10.1017/jfm.2015.730},
  abstract = {Since its introduction in the late 19th century, symmetry breaking has been found to play a crucial role in physics. In particular, it appears as one key phenomenon controlling hydrodynamic and acoustic instabilities in problems with rotational symmetries. A previous paper investigated its desired potential application to the control of circumferential thermoacoustic modes in one annular cavity coupled with multiple flames (Bauerheim et~al., J.~Fluid Mech., vol.~760, 2014, pp.~431\textendash{}465). The present paper focuses on a similar problem when symmetry breaking appears unintentionally, for example when uncertainties due to tolerances are taken into account. It yields a large uncertainty quantification (UQ) problem containing numerous uncertain parameters. To tackle this well-known `curse of dimensionality', a novel UQ methodology is used. It relies on the active subspace approach to construct a reduced set of input variables. This strategy is applied on two annular cavities coupled by 19 flames to determine its modal risk factor, i.e.~the probability of an azimuthal acoustic mode being unstable. Since each flame is modelled by two uncertain parameters, it leads to a large UQ problem involving 38 parameters. An acoustic network model is then derived, which yields a nonlinear dispersion relation for azimuthal modes. This nonlinear problem, subject to bifurcations, is solved quasi-analytically. Results show that the dimension of the probabilistic problem can be drastically reduced, from 38 uncertain parameters to only 3. Moreover, it is found that the three active variables are related to physical quantities, which unveils underlying phenomena controlling the stability of the two coupled cavities. The first active variable is associated with a coupling strength controlling the bifurcation of the system, while the two others correspond to a symmetry-breaking effect induced by the uncertainties. Thus, an additional destabilization effect appear caused by the non-uniform pattern of the uncertainty distribution, which breaks the initial rotating symmetry of the annular cavities. Finally, the active subspace is exploited by fitting the response surface with polynomials (linear, quadratic and cubic). By comparing accuracy and cost, results prove that 5~\% error can be achieved with only 30 simulations on the reduced space, whereas 2000 are required on the complete initial space. It exemplifies that this novel UQ technique can accurately predict the risk factor of an annular configuration at low cost as well as unveil key parameters controlling the stability.},

  doi = {10.1115/GT2017-64829},
  abstract = {Thermoacoustic instabilities are a major threat for modern gas turbines. Frequency-domain based stability methods, such as network models and Helmholtz solvers, are common design tools because they are fast compared to compressible CFD computations. Frequency-domain approaches result in an eigenvalue problem, which is nonlinear with respect to the eigenvalue. Nonlinear functions of the frequency are, for example, the n\textendash$\tau$ model, impedance boundary conditions, etc. Thus, the influence of the relevant parameters on mode stability is only given implicitly. Small changes in some model parameters, which are obtained by experiments with some uncertainty, may have a great impact on stability. The assessment of how parameter uncertainties propagate to system stability is therefore crucial for safe gas turbine operation. This question is addressed by uncertainty quantification. A common strategy for uncertainty quantification in thermoacoustics is risk factor analysis. It quantifies the uncertainty of a set of parameters in terms of the probability of a mode to become unstable.One general challenge regarding uncertainty quantification is the sheer number of uncertain parameter combinations to be quantified. For instance, uncertain parameters in an annular combustor might be the equivalence ratio, convection times, geometrical parameters, boundary impedances, flame response model parameters etc. Assessing also the influence of all possible combinations of these parameters on the risk factor is a numerically very costly task.A new and fast way to obtain algebraic parameter models in order to tackle the implicit nature of the eigenfrequency problem is using adjoint perturbation theory. Though adjoint perturbation methods were recently applied to accelerate the risk factor analysis, its potential to improve the theory has not yet been fully exploited. This paper aims to further utilize adjoint methods for the quantification of uncertainties. This analytical method avoids the usual random Monte Carlo simulations, making it particularly attractive for industrial purposes. Using network models and the open-source Helmholtz solver PyHoltz it is also discussed how to apply the method with standard modeling techniques. The theory is exemplified based on a simple ducted flame and a combustor of EM2C laboratory for which experimental validation is available.},

  abstract = {The thermoacoustic behavior of a combustion system can be determined numerically via acoustic tools such as Helmholtz solvers or network models coupled with a model for the flame dynamic response. Within such a framework, the flame response to flow perturbations can be described by a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) model, which can be derived from LES time series via system identification. However, the estimated FIR model will inevitably contain uncertainties due to the statistical nature of the identification process, low signal-to-noise ratio or finite length of time series. Thus, a necessary step towards reliable thermoacoustic stability analysis is to quantify the impact of uncertainties in FIR model on the growth rate of thermoacoustic modes. There are two practical considerations involved in this topic. First, how to efficiently propagate uncertainties from the FIR model to the modal growth rate of the system, considering it is a high dimensional uncertainty quantification (UQ) problem? Second, since longer CFD simulation time generally leads to less uncertain FIR model identification, how to determine the length of the CFD simulation required to obtain satisfactory confidence? To address the two issues, a dimensional reduction UQ methodology called ‘‘Active Subspace approach'' is employed in the present study. For the first question, Active Subspace approach is applied to exploit a low-dimensional approximation of the original system, which allows accelerated UQ analysis. Good agreement with Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates the accuracy of the method. For the second question, a procedure based on Active Subspace approach is proposed, which can serve as an indicator for terminating CFD simulation. The effectiveness of the procedure is verified in the paper.},

  abstract = {In this paper, non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion (NIPCE) is used for forward uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of thermoacoustic stability of two premixed flame configurations. The first configuration is a turbulent swirl combustor, modeled by the Helmholtz equation with an n - $\tau$ flame model. Uncertain input parameters are the gain and the time delay of the flame, as well as the magnitude and the phase of the outlet reflection coefficient. NIPCE is successfully validated against Monte Carlo simulation. It is observed that the first order expansion suffices to yield accurate results. The second configuration under investigation is a low order network model of a laminar slit burner, with the flame transfer function identified from weakly compressible CFD simulations of laminar reacting flow. Firstly the uncertainty and sensitivity of the growth rate due to three uncertain input parameters of the CFD model \textendash{} i.e., flow velocity, burner plate temperature and equivalence ratio \textendash{} are analyzed. A Monte Carlo simulation is no longer possible due to the computational cost of the CFD simulations. Secondly, two additional uncertain parameters are taken into account, i.e., the respective magnitudes of inlet and outlet reflection coefficients. This extension of the analysis does not entail a considerable increase in computational cost, since the additional parameters are included only in the low order network model. In both cases, the second order expansion is sufficient to model the uncertainties in growth rate.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of premixed confined swirling flames is investigated by examining their response to incident velocity perturbations. A generalized transfer function designated as the flame describing function (FDF) is determined by sweeping a frequency range extending from 0 to 400 Hz and by changing the root mean square fluctuation level between 0\% and 72\% of the bulk velocity. The unsteady heat release rate is deduced from the emission intensity of OH* radicals. This global information is complemented by phase conditioned Abel transformed emission images. This processing yields the distribution of light emission. By assuming that the light intensity is proportional to the heat release rate, it is possible to deduce the distribution of unsteady heat release rate in W m-3 and see how it evolves with time during the modulation cycle and for different forcing frequencies. These data can be useful for the determination of regimes of instability but also give clues on the mechanisms which control the swirling flame dynamics. It is found from experiments and demonstrated analytically that a swirler submitted to axial acoustic waves originating from the upstream manifold generates a vorticity wave on its downstream side. The flame is then submitted to a transmitted axial acoustic perturbation which propagates at the speed of sound and to an azimuthal velocity perturbation which is convected at the flow velocity. The net result is that the dynamical response and unsteady heat release rate are determined by the combined effects of these axial and induced azimuthal velocity perturbations. The former disturbance induces a shedding of vortices from the injector lip which roll-up the flame extremity while the latter effectively perturbs the swirl number which results in an angular oscillation of the flame root. This motion is equivalent to that which would be induced by perturbations of the burning velocity. The phase between incident perturbations is controlled by the convective time delay between the swirler and the injector. The constructive or destructive interference between the different perturbations is shown to yield the low and high gains observed for certain frequencies.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.proci.2018.07.020},
  abstract = {The flame response to upstream velocity perturbations is properly described by a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) model. When combining an FIR model with acoustic tools to predict thermoacoustic modal growth rates, uncertainties contained in the FIR model coefficients would propagate through the acoustic model, inducing deviations of the modal growth rate from its nominal value. Therefore, an associated uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis, which focuses on quantifying the impact of FIR model uncertainties on the modal growth rate prediction, is a necessity to obtain a more reliable thermoacoustic instability prediction. To address this UQ problem, our present work proposes an analytical strategy featuring (1) compactly summarizing the causal relationship between variations of FIR model coefficients and variations of modal growth rates; (2) Effectively shrinking the dimension of the UQ problem; (3) Requiring only negligible computational cost; (4) Involving no complex mathematical treatments. Our case studies yielded 6000 times faster yet highly accurate UQ analyses compared with reference Monte Carlo simulations, even though a significant level of FIR model uncertainty is present. The analytical approach brings additional benefits including (1) visualization of the process from the variations of FIR model coefficients to the variations of modal growth rate; (2) Easily-obtainable sensitivity measurement for each FIR model coefficient, which can help identify key mechanisms controlling the thermoacoustic instability; (3) New possibility for robust combustor design, i.e., to minimize the impact of FIR model uncertainty on the thermoacoustic instability prediction.},
